CSSconf and JSconf 2014
=======================

Once upon a time, I went to a conference.  
And these are my notes (sometimes thoughts) from a few of the speakers that I attedned (and paid attention).  

The hope of sharing my notes this way is in the hope that it will:  
1. Help those in the community who were not able to attend the conference still gain some useful knowledge nuggests  
2. Have the community help improve the captured notes. And what better way to handle conitrbutions than with forks and pull requests :-)  

So with that being said, sharing and contributions are encouraged.


#### Disclaimer
These notes were taking while the presentations were going on, then slightly edited afterward based off memory. So Obviosuly they won't be as good as experiencing the real thing.  
Also I'm really bad at spelling, so you are garanteed to find some silly typo's.

Happy reading!
