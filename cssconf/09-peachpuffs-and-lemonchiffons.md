# Peachpuffs and Lemonchiffons (aka: CSS colors, the named ones)

The history of named colors in CSS  

The named colors come from the X11 color (or more specficially, X10R3) back in 1983, in a file named rgb.txt
Started out wit just 69 entires, now there are a lot more. Originally for the DECVT240  

FUN FACT: "gray" and "grey" are both a thing... becausoe of programmers that didn't know how to spell (the English way vs the American way).  

Paul Raveling, John C thoman and Jim Fultom <-- fathers of modern X11 names.  

Bottom line:
* CSS colors come from X11
* X11 names came from a box of crayons
* colors where originall calibrated based on Paul R. HP monitor
* a lot of the names suck and are terribly inconsistent
* and some of them are potentially racist (indian red, navajo white, peru)
